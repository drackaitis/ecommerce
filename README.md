# The Ecommerce Web Application (WIP)
This is a portfolio project by Deividas R., aimed at showcasing the proficiency with technologies, such as:

- TypeScript - Angular - Node.js - Express.js - MySQL - GraphQL - Apollo - TypeORM - Jest

The idea is to create a shopping site that allows for basic browsing, authentication via JWT, and simple shopping cart operations.
If time allows it, the design of the application should display good practice in aspects of security, accessablity and search engine optimization.
